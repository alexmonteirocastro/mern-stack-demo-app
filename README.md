# MERN STACK APP

This is an full-stack application built for learning purposes. 

The back-end is built with: 

* NodeJS
* Express.js
* MongoDB

The front-end is built with: 

 * React.js
 * Redux

# What have learned from this project?

How to:

* Set up a full-stack application;
* Build a back-end:
    * Set up a server with Express.js;
    * Prepare some API endpoints;
    * Connect the back-end to a non-relational database (MongoDB);
* Build a front-end:
    * Build the UI with React.js and using Reactstrap components;
    * State Management accross the whole application with Redux;
* Implement the connection between the front-end with the back-end: 
    * So that we can send, fetch and delete data from the database into the client side;
    * The communication between front-end and back-end is handled by the reducers (state management with Redux);
* Deploy to heroku;
